        Egypt is very famous for its ancient civilization and the monuments of the majestic pharaohs, such as the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Great Sphinx, the Egyptian Museum, the GEM (The Grand Egyptian Museum), Sakkara, and Dahshur.Egypt is famous for the Pyramids, Sahara Desert, and Nile River. It's known for its ruins, historical places, and sites of world wonders. It is also famous for its mesmerizing beaches, coral reefs, and sea cruises. On top of that, Egypt is also known for its people's humorous spirit.<br><br>
        <h3><b>Pyramids Of Giza</b><br>
        </h3>The last surviving wonder of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Pyramids of Giza are one of the world's most recognizable landmarks.
    
        Having awed travelers down through the ages, these tombs of the Pharaohs Cheops (Khufu), Chephren (Khafre), and Mycerinus (Menkaure), guarded by the enigmatic Sphinx, are usually top of most visitor's lists of tourist attractions to see in Egypt and often the first sight they head to after landing.
        
        Today, sitting on the desert edge of Cairo's sprawl, these megalithic memorials to dead pharaohs are still as wondrous a sight as they ever were and an undeniable highlight of any Egypt trip.<br><br>

        <h3><b>Explore Islamic Cairo </b><br></h3>
        The atmospheric, narrow lanes of the capital's Islamic Cairo district are crammed full of mosques, madrassas (Islamic schools of learning), and monuments dating from the Fatimid through to the Mameluke eras.

This is where you'll find the labyrinth shopping souq of Khan el-Khalili, where coppersmiths and artisans still have their tiny workshops, and stalls are laden with ceramics, textiles, spice, and perfume.

Surrounding the market is a muddle of roads, home to some of the most beautiful preserved architecture of the old Islamic empires.

There is a wealth of history here to explore. Visit Al-Azhar Mosque and the dazzling Sultan Hassan Mosque, and make sure to climb up to the roof of the ancient medieval gate of Bab Zuweila for the best minaret-speckled panoramas across the district.<br><br>

    <h3><b> Egyptian Museum
    </b></h3>
    A treasure trove of the Pharaonic world, Cairo's Egyptian Museum is one of the world's great museum collections. The faded pink mansion in downtown Cairo is home to a dazzling amount of exhibits.

It's a higgledy-piggledy place, with little labeling on offer and chronological order severely lacking. Instead every corner you turn here is home to some wonderful piece of ancient art or statuary, which would be the highlight of any other museum.

The museum's star collection is the haul of golden treasures unearthed from Tutankhamen's tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

Travelers should note that the Egyptian Museum's swag of riches is in the process of being transferred to the new Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) in Giza, near the pyramids, which is tentatively due to open (after years of delays) in November 2022.

The GEM will finally provide this world-class collection with a worthy showcase, and the entirety of Tutankhamen's treasures, many of which have been kept in storage for years, will finally be completely on display.

        The culture of Egypt has thousands of years of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest civilizations in the world. For millennia, Egypt developed strikingly unique, complex and stable cultures that influenced other cultures of Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
        The Egyptians believed that joy and happiness were legitimate goals of life and regarded home and family as the major source of delight.‚Äù Because of this belief, women enjoyed a higher prestige in Egypt than in any other culture of the ancient world.
