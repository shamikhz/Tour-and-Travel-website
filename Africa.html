<h2 style="color: red">Places</h2>
<div class="places">
    Africa is a vast continent, an immense landscape of incredible contrasts, from beaches to mountains, deserts to wetlands, and mountains to endless open savannah. You can meet people whose way of life has not changed in centuries, and witness wildlife spectacles that have followed ancient rhythms for millennia.<br>
    <br><b>Victoria Falls</b><br>
    Outdoorsy types travel far and wide to admire this breathtaking UNESCO World Heritage Site. Straddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is roughly twice as deep and wide as Niagara Falls, making it one of the world's most impressive waterfalls. To see this natural wonder at its prime, plan a visit in April when the region's rainy season has concluded. Popular vantage points include the Knife-Edge Bridge, Livingstone Island and Devil's Pool. When you're not enjoying the view from above, go whitewater rafting in the Zambezi River to admire the falls from a different angle.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Zanzibar</b><br>Zanzibar offers something for everyone, whether you're in search of beautiful beaches or an unforgettable adventure. After trekking to this Indian Ocean archipelago off of Africa's eastern coast, you'll instantly feel at ease as you lounge on quiet beaches like Matemwe and Pongwe. Next, visit Zanzibar City's UNESCO World Heritage-listed Stone Town, where you'll find the ruins of a 19th-century palace and a graveyard with ties to Zanzibar's former Arab royals. And no trip would be complete without taking a spice tour in the countryside and exploring Jozani-Chwaka Bay National Park.
